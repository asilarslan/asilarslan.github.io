Hey everyone,

First off, Blue Notify has now changed name to **f+**. Version 2 has a while to complete mainly because of many reasons:

*   There&#8217;s a new Post screen which means that launching the browser is a thing of the past!*
*   New Places shortcut  which displays a floating Dialog box for you to &#8216;check-in&#8217;.
*   Upload multiple (and single) photos with the Gallery by selecting multiple files, then sharing with f+.
*   Lots and lots and lots of bugfixes!

You can see some screenshots of the new screen [here][1].

Let me know what you think!

**v2.0.1**

Version 2.0.1 has just been upload onto the Market and should fix alot of the FCs and bugs you&#8217;ve been experiencing. I&#8217;ve been running f+ for the past week without a hitch, but I always knew there would be bugs that would spring up when the app went live. Just bear with me while I fix them.  <img src='http://i2.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" />
