<p>After releasing the <a href="http://www.senab.co.uk/2012/07/09/photup-v0-9-beta-1/" target="_blank">first beta</a> a couple of days ago, I’ve been busy at work on the second beta.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>Changelog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Much improved Facebook Session resilience.  </li>
<li>New Login Screen, with logout.  </li>
<li>New Flow to picking photos (checkmark icon at top right to select, press to view photo).  </li>
<li>New Upload Tab (with Swipe-to-Dismiss completed items) to see which photos are uploading.  </li>
<li>Improved Notifications. Using Progress Bar for ICS, BigPictureStyle for JB.  </li>
<li>Those on Jelly Bean get the scale up animation when viewing a photo.  </li>
<li>Delay before doing Face Detection, as it was slowing down Photo Viewer.</li>
</ul>
