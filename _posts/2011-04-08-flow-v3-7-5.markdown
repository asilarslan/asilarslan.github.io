Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just put up v3.7.5 of Flow onto the Android Market:

*   New! Reply button at end of Inbox Message threads
*   Added Remove Friend as a Long-Press option on Friends List
*   Fix 2 long standing bug which caused FCs (I never saw them, but they appear in the error reports **a lot**)
*   Fix bug where only the first 25 Photo/Albums would show
*   Fix bug where Database would not be deleted on logout
*   Fix link to Gmail Notification Setup Blog Post
*   Fix for Likes not showing on Photo Posts
*   Fix bug where refreshing an Inbox Message thread would display blank
*   Other small bugfixes
*   Updated translations (including a new Czech one, thanks @ZdenekVanik)

Let me know how you get on!
