I really like iOS&#8217; inbuilt Reminders app. The fact that it interfaces with Siri has made my life loads easier. There are a couple of things that need improving though<!--more-->:

*   Sorting of Tasks. It&#8217;s a bit weird, I expect it to sort by reminder time, not the time I created the task.
*   Default View. It defaults to List view where I can see all of my tasks for the week. I&#8217;d prefer an option to make the Day view the default.
*   Notification Badge. I&#8217;d like the badge to show how many tasks I&#8217;m overdue on.

Other than that, it&#8217;s great! Definitely a feature on iOS that Android should have by default.
