Hey everyone,

As you probably noticed version 2.2.1 of the application was released onto the Market today in both paid and free editions. It wasn&#8217;t a massive release, but there were quite a few bug fixes and the like in it:

*   New Mark All Notifications as Read feature
*   Small UI enhancements
*   Create .nomedia file to stop cache showing in Gallery
*   *Disable using geolocation for ads (Free only)*
*   Several FCs fixed: 
    *   Hopefully fixed logout issue.
    *   Album List *should* now work for everyone

Let me know how you get on. I&#8217;ll already have v2.2.2 in the works, it should be out over the weekend with browsing Friend&#8217;s photos and other goodies.
