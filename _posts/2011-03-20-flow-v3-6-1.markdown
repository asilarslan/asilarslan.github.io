Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just uploaded v3.6.1 of Flow onto the Android Market:

*   Fixed Random Crashes (caused by new image stuff)
*   Fixed loads of FCs found in Error Reports
*   Disable adding Post Tags for now, Facebook seem to have blocked the way Flow was doing it
*   Fix wrong images shown in Edit Photos with some devices

Let me know how you get on!

Chris
