Hey everyone,

Flow v3.7.7 has just been released onto the Market, including:

*   Fix Favourites being lost after logging out
*   Alternative Logout has been removed. The reason for this is due to piracy, by removing the Alternative Login all logins have to go through the Official Facebook app. By doing this, it should stop pirated copies of Flow being able to login.
*   Fix for text on Reply button on Inbox Messages
*   Replying to an Inbox Message will now open Facebook app, if installed
*   Fix for not all comments showing on posts
*   Small improvements to Profile Info tab

Let me know how it goes
