Hey everyone,

As you can see, Flow has been renamed to FriendCaster! This is because Flow has been acquired by [Handmark][1]. Anyway, this release didn&#8217;t really include any new function and was needed just to get the balling rolling, in terms of handing over to Handmark. One thing I would like to make clear is that I am still **very** much involved in FriendCaster&#8217;s development, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

Changelog:

*   Changed Free version to use Handmark&#8217;s ad service. Now has the option of disabling Ads for 30 days if you post about the app.
*   New Styled Post Screen

Chris
