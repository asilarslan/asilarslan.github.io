Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just released v2.0.10 onto the Market:

*   Changed the name to &#8216;f-plus&#8217;, this is mainly for SEO.
*   Fixed bug where certain posts wouldn&#8217;t show (thanks to Bob for supplying lots of log for me to debug this). The problem lay in the URL not being encoded properly by one of the Android classes, I&#8217;ve reverted back to a standard Java class and it&#8217;s working nicely now. **fingers crossed**
*   Fixed a F/C which happened when posting comments on photos.
*   Other small stuff I can&#8217;t remember.

Thanks,

Chris
