Version 2.0.5 was released onto the Market earlier.

*   Facebook images should now be fixed (Facebook have changed their URL formats again, therefore I&#8217;ve had to do some &#8216;magic&#8217; to get it to work)
*   Can now choose whether to show a task bar icon when syncing with Facebook.
*   Can now choose whether to be notified once per notification, or once per refresh (similar to how Gmail does it).
*   Fixed couple of FCs

Thanks,

Chris
