Blue Notify v1.0.2 has just been released onto the Market. There&#8217;s no additional functionality in this version, just improved icons and graphics.

My original plan was to allow the notifications to be open in the official Facebook Android application. Unfortunately this just isn&#8217;t possible as the Facebook app is &#8220;limited&#8221; in this respect. I can open up your message inbox, and a specific photo but unfortunately I can&#8217;t open up a specific wall post or anything like that. My backup plan is to create a popup notification (similar to SMS Popup) but this is going to require more work and will take time. This is planned for v1.2.

Version 1.1 will add notifications for Friend Requests, Pokes and Updates and will be out soon.
