Hi,<a href="http://i0.wp.com/178.239.161.90/~senabcou/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/snapshot.png" rel="lightbox[54]"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-56" title="V1.1 Widget" src="http://i1.wp.com/178.239.161.90/~senabcou/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/snapshot.png?resize=100%2C150" alt="V1.1 Widget" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

I&#8217;ve just released v1.1.0 of Blue Notify onto Android Market. This release brings:

</p> 
*   Working widget!


*   Couple of bug fixes


*   Whenever it receives an IOException (due to not working net connection) it now retries after 15 seconds. This should fix the reasons for the app not notifying you.


*   Improvements in the opening of the Facebook application. It now works with both Inbox Messages and notifications connected to Photos, unfortunately the Facebook app won&#8217;t let me open up anything else. If you select the Facebook app as your launch preference then Blue Notify will fall back to the Touch Website for anything that can&#8217;t be opened in the Facebook application.


*   Preference cleanup.
</ul> 
I&#8217;ll post about what&#8217;s going to come up in v1.2 later <img src='http://i1.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

**V1.1.1**  
This a bug fix release for the widget, although it seems that people are still having problems with missing notifications. Expect a 1.1.2 release tomorrow/Monday.
