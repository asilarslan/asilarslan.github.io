<p>Version 2.4 was released earlier. Here&#8217;s a quick changelog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Birthday Notification launching fixed.</li>
<li>Fix for a couple of FCs that have cropped up in the Crash Report logs.</li>
<li>New version of the database library F-Plus uses (<a href="http://ormlite.sourceforge.net/">OrmLite</a>).</li>
<li>(Basic) News Feed</li>
<li>Ability to Like comments and Photos</li>
<li>Removed Places (will be back much improved in a later release).</li>
<li>New version of Database library should fix the corrupt database problem</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the time would not be correct</li>
<li>Fixed bug of profile pictures not updating (cached images now go &#8216;stale&#8217; after 5 days).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve had a report of problems when using the &#8220;Delete Email&#8221; option for Gmail in the Paid version (Free version doesn&#8217;t have this functionality). If you&#8217;re using this option and are having problems with missing notifications, disable the option for now. I&#8217;m looking into this.</em></p>

<p>The next major release will be version 3.0 which will include Friend Walls and Profiles, the only releases in between (if any) will be small bug fix releases.</p>
