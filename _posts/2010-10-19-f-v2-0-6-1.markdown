I&#8217;ve just released v2.0.6 onto the Market. It fixes my mess up with v2.0.5 where the launcher icon disappeared (Doh!).

It also has:

*   Notification List is now an option for Widget Open settings
*   Now remembers position in Notification list when navigating back from posts.
*   Fixed bug where notifications would show as unread in the list, even though they had been set as read.

v2.0.6.1 has also been released which fixes a small bug where notifications wouldn&#8217;t be set as read on Facebook. This will be the last update forÂ  a couple of days (unless there&#8217;s a massive bug that needs fixing).
