Hi everyone,

Now that Google seem to have fixed the Android Market, I&#8217;ve just put up v3.7.2 of Flow. This release includes:

*   New! Inbox Messages inbuilt
*   New! Clear Image Cache Preference (under Advanced Settings)
*   Changed Profile Picture refresh back to 2 days (if you want new profile pictures, Clear the Image Cache using the new option)
*   Fix for Friends not saving to database (sometimes)
*   Fix Likes count not being correct (Facebook changed something again)
*   New Take Photo Button on News Feed/Wall

Let me know how you get on <img src='http://i2.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

### Update &#8211; v3.7.2.1

I&#8217;ve just put up v3.7.2.1 onto the Market. It seems that the Google Spreadsheet that my Error Reports upload to, has increased to a point where I can&#8217;t actually view it (I need to start clearing it more often). This means that I can&#8217;t view any error reports sent over the past week or so. This release fixes that because I&#8217;ve changed the spreadsheet. This release also includes update translations.
