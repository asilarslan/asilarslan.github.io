Blue Notify v1.1.9 has just been released onto the Market. After hours of trying different things and pouring over logs, I&#8217;ve think I&#8217;ve managed to fix the notifications Â stopping after a few hours. There was nothing wrong with the code in Blue Notify, seems like a Android bug to me but there we go. I&#8217;m now doing it all a different way and it&#8217;s been working great for me (and my beta testers) over the past day or two.

*   Major refactoring of code which is **much** easier to maintain. I&#8217;m now using a IntentService to do all the network stuff which should help to lower CPU consumption.
*   Notifications should now be fixed, as mentioned above.
*   **New feature!** It now notifies you when if it&#8217;s any of your Friends&#8217; Birthdays today. This feature was planned for v1.2 but it&#8217;s working well so here it is. It&#8217;s currently fixed at refreshing daily at 10:00am, this will be an configurable in v1.2 though.

P.S. There wasn&#8217;t a released v1.14-1.1.8 <img src='http://i2.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

### v1.2 Preview

Now that notifications are working properly I can started adding features again. This weekend is a Bank Holiday in England (3 day weekend) therefore I am probably going to spend about a day (or 2) working on Blue Notify. You can expect v1.2 to be out early next week with the following features:

*   New icons
*   Notifications for Friend Requests, Event Requests and Pokes
*   Customizable LED Settings
*   Configurable Birthday Refresh Time
