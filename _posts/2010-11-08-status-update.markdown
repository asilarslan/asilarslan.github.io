Hey everyone,

Just a bit of a status update for you all. I&#8217;ve had a couple of comments saying that when the &#8216;Facebook Application&#8217; is set as the launch operation, it doesn&#8217;t open it for all notifications. This is &#8216;intentional&#8217;, simply because that the Facebook application does not allow me to open up all the screens available within it&#8217;s application; because of this I wrote the &#8216;f+ Post Screen&#8217;. I recommend you use this as it will open the Facebook application for images, etc anyway! The other options were re-added as legacy options and I may remove these as they are causing confusion for people.

The next thing is that I&#8217;m currently working on Push notifications. Progress is slow but steady and within the next couple of days I should have a working version for me to use and test. I don&#8217;t really have anything other to say on this, other than I am working on it. <img src='http://i0.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" />
