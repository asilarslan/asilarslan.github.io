Hi everyone,

As you may have seen in the Android Market listings, I&#8217;ve partnered with [Handmark][1] to help take &#8216;Flow for Facebook&#8217; to the next level, and help get it in front of millions of more users. I&#8217;m still heavily involved and we&#8217;ve got some great stuff planned for next few releases.

There will probably be some more official annoucements in the near future, this is just a short post to answer the questions I&#8217;ve been receiving about the transfer on Android Market.

Chris
