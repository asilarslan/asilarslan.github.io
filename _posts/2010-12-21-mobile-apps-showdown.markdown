Hey everyone,

F-Plus has been selected as a finalist for Mobile Apps Showdown, with the winner being unveiled at CES 2011 in Las Vegas. I know this is a blatant plug but could you please vote.Â The ballot box is <a href="http://www.mobileappsshowdown.com/ballot-box/" target="_blank">here</a>. You have 25 votes each (and feel free to vote more than once for f-plus, just keep clicking!).

Thanks,
