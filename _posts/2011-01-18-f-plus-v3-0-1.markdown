Hey everyone,

Here&#8217;s v3.0.1, a big bugfix release for the version 3 released a couple of days ago.

*   **New Notification Popup!** It&#8217;s not finished yet but will be for v3.1. Enable it under &#8216;Alert Settings&#8217;.
*   Fix for Database corruption issue. Should never happen again now and should give a small performance increase too.
*   Notification refresh performance increase (only downloads unread notifications majority of the time now).
*   Increased amount of Newsfeed/Wall posts each refresh (12 now, v3 was set to 10).
*   NewsFeed/Wall now starts updating before you reach the end of the list. Should make browsing more fluid.
*   New &#8216;Clear Preferences&#8217; option under Advanced Settings. Might help people having login issues.
*   Small layout fix for RTL languages.
*   Fix for rotating Image Viewer not loading.
*   Fix couple of other FCs.

Let me know how you get on!
