In this post I&#8217;m going to detail some of the functionality I want to include in the app, and a indication of the likely release it will be included in:

### v.3.1.x

*   Fix Birthday Notifications (needs a far bit of work).
*   General bugfixing.

### v3.2

*   Pull To Refresh. Similar to how &#8216;Twitter for Android&#8217; and lots of iPhone apps do it. *(about 50% completed so far)*
*   Zoomable Images *(about 70% completed so far, just need to integrate it with photo tagging)*
*   Event syncing with Calendar **(this will be a paid  feature only)**.
*   Setup Wizard. *(Might be pushed back to v3.3)*
*   Improved Widget. Lots of people have email me asking for an improved Widget, but I&#8217;m not sure what people actually want from it. Let me know.
