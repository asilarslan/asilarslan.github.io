If you haven't seen Philm yet, it is a movie collection and information app that I created for Android. It uses the Trakt and TMDB APIs.

This morning I pushed the source of Philm to [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbanes/philm) under the Apache v2.0 licence.

This does __not__ mean that I have stopped development, it's just got to the point where I'm happy with it so can share the source.

Philm has been a bit of an experiment as it uses a type of MVC-type architecture to split out UI, business and model code, something that has not really be explored (publicly) in Android development.

I will write a follow up post soon detailing all of this, but now just have a look in the source.
