Hey everyone,

Flow v3.4 is what I&#8217;ve been working on for the past couple of days. It includes quite a few new features which I personally really like:

*   Zoomable Images. For devices with FroYo and above, you&#8217;ve got multi-touch zoom and double tap. For those on Eclair and below, you&#8217;ve just got the double tap. I&#8217;ve removed the swipe to move to the next/previous photo too, there&#8217;s now two icons at the bottom of the screen.
*   New Post Status/Link Screen! The same screen is now used for normally posting & Sharing Links & Text (via the Browser/Twitter/etc). Sharing text also now works properly. This new screen also has the added feature of being able to select the Privacy for each post. New Launcher Shortcut is available too.
*   Notifications for Friend Requests, Event Invites and Group Invites!
*   The Newsfeed is now backed up with a database cache! This is important for two reasons, firstly when you first open the Newsfeed you&#8217;ll get the previously downloaded feed items, which is better than looking at a blank screen while it downloads the new posts. Secondly it paves the way for a bigger better widget.
*   Performance increase. I&#8217;ve removed some innocent looking code that, through analysis, showed that it wasted about 1-2 seconds EACH call to Facebook. This means that Flow will be 1-2 seconds quicker when downloading information from Facebook. I&#8217;ve tested the speed compared to the official app, and while Flow is still slower (~3 secs vs ~2 secs to get the Newsfeed over WiFi), it&#8217;s no longer painfully slow.
*   Possible fix for Thumbnails not loading and constantly showing as Loading
*   I&#8217;m 99% sure I&#8217;ve also fixed the problems people have been having with Flow not refreshing in the background.
*   Profile ScreenÂ  has had the top bar removed. It didn&#8217;t do anything anyway therefore I&#8217;ve removed it to save screen space.
*   Other small UI improvements here and there.
