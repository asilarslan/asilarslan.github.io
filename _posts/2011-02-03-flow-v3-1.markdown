Hey everyone,

I just uploaded v3.1 of Flow onto the Market. This release includes:

*   Reverted the Home Screen
*   New Events View
*   Fixed Memory Leak
*   New Share Link Screen. (Go to your browser &#8211;> Share Page)
*   Post Status Box now scrolls with List

I apologise for the delay in uploading, this release was actually finished a couple of days ago but I thought I&#8217;d start working on &#8216;Pull To Refresh&#8217; for the app. Unfortunately the quality of what I&#8217;ve got so far isn&#8217;t good enough for use, therefore I&#8217;ve released it without the &#8216;Pull To Refresh&#8217; function. There is another post detailing what I&#8217;m writing for v3.2, let me know what you think.
