title: Blue Notify v1.1.3

I&#8217;ve just released v1.1.3 onto the Market. I&#8217;ve had quite a few people tell me that Blue Notify just isn&#8217;t notifying you, and I think I&#8217;ve found some possible reasons why. On my device (Desire) it has been working fine, therefore there is nothing wrong with the code as such, just that I haven&#8217;t considered devices with lower memory constraints (mainly because I lost my G1 last month).

Therefore as a quick fix, I&#8217;ve changed the app so that it holds a Wake Lock for notifications. This may or may not work, I&#8217;m not totally sure as I&#8217;m guessing as to why those people aren&#8217;t being notified. The next version v1.1.4 will have a logging feature in it which will mean that when people have problems, they&#8217;ll be able to send me a trace of what the application is actually doing.

The proper fix will be to move everything into a Service, something I was hoping against doing this but it looks like it needs to be done. This will happen before v1.2 as I want the basics completely working (well, 99% <img src='http://i0.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> ) before I start adding features.

Sorry everyone if you&#8217;ve had any problems!
