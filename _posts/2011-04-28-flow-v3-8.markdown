Hey everyone,

Here&#8217;s the latest instalment of Flow. It includes:

*   New! Video Uploading
*   Performance Improvements for Uploading
*   Photo Uploads show now have the correct orientation
*   Video Posts now play in Video Player
*   New! Widget. This is just a start, there will be more sizes and types coming in future releases. When used, it&#8217;s currently set to update every 2 hours, I&#8217;ll add this as a preference in the next release.
*   Fix for Notification&#8217;s not refreshing in background
*   Fix for random Database FCs
*   New Long Press options on Inbox Messages (View Profile & Copy)
*   Links in Inbox Messages now show
*   Fix Checkin Places using old cache GPS location

### v3.8.0.1

*   Fix Video Uploads for Paid version. Sorry!
*   Fix Text Colour on Upload Screen
