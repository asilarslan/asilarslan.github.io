I&#8217;ve just put up v1.2.2 of Blue Notify onto Android Market. This version contains only bug fixes and internal changes:

*   The bug where the wrong notification is launched when pressed, should be fixed.
*   Scheduled notifications stopping should be fixed.
*   Clean-up the database when reading notifications.
