Hey,

Version 2.0.9 has just been released onto the Market.

*   Totally removed the Service task bar Icon and reverted back to using a Wake Lock. This should stop the problems with the service not refreshing when the screen is off.
*   Links and Photos are now displayed in the Comment screen. Pressing on the image will load up either the link or the image. **Please note: **Pressing the like button is not working for photos, I&#8217;m still trying to work out how to fix it. Comments will work fine though.
*   Small UI enhancements.
*   Fixed a couple of F/Cs
*   Other stuff I&#8217;ve forgot.

Version&#8217;s v2.0.9.1 & 2.0.9.2 have been released onto the Market since. They fix marking a notification as read.

Thanks,

Chris
