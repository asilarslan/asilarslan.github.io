Hey,

Version 3.2.1 was just released onto the Android Market:

*   Improved the way GPS and Location is found on Places list
*   Added Search and Add Place function to Places
*   Now correctly downloads all comments from a post
*   Menu Refresh has been removed (it shouldn&#8217;t have been there)
*   Correctly display Person&#8217;s birthday according to your locale
*   Adding Groups and Events as a Favourite is now fixed

Thanks,
