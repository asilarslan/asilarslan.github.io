I thought it might be a good idea to give you all an indication of where f+ is going in the future and what features you can expect.

### v2.0.x

This is the current code line and is where work is currently taking place. Over the next 2 or 3 releases you&#8217;ll get bug fixes and small feature enhancements:

*   **Poke and Request (Friend, Event, etc) notifications**
*   **Small UI enhancements**

### Future

Now obviously this isn&#8217;t set in stone but here&#8217;s a few things that I have planned for the near future:

*   **Improve the UI.** One thing I do not want to do is emulate the Facebook application. The Official Android Facebook application may be limited but what it does, I think it does fairly well. f+&#8217;s mission is to fill the gaps that it doesn&#8217;t do, not reinvent the wheel.
*   **Push Notifications.** Now this is a complex thing to do and will take time, but is definitely something I&#8217;m looking at seriously.
*   **Improved widgets**
*   **News Feed View**
*   **Contact List**

I&#8217;m interested in what other features people want from the app, add a comment below and let me know.
