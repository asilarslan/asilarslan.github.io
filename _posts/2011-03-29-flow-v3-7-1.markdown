Hey,

I&#8217;ve just put v3.7.1 onto the Market. It includes:

*   Add some error messages when logging in fails
*   Profile pictures are now deleted after 6 hours (should help make them more current)
*   Long pressing on a album now allows you see Album Comments
*   Massively improved look of the application
*   Uploading Photos to Groups/Pages now works correctly (only if you&#8217;re an Admin though)
*   Ability to set Deny List (as well as Allow List) for Post Privacy
*   Notifications now optional
*   Bug fixes!

Let me know how you get on&#8230;

&nbsp;

EDIT

v3.7.1.1 was just released onto the Market with some quick bug fixes for:

*   Donut Device FCs
*   Photo Uploading
*   Text Colour on Home Icons (for some devices)
*   Updated Translations
