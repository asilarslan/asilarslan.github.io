Hey,

I&#8217;ve just released v.1.2.3 onto the Market. Features include:

*   Facebook Zero (http://0.facebook.com) support
*   Organised the Preferences a bit better
*   Filter which type of Facebook notifications alert you (Likes and Comments at the moment).
*   Friends&#8217; Birthdays notifications now open Facebook application (if you have the Facebook application set as your preference).

Get it on Android Market <img src='http://i2.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" />
