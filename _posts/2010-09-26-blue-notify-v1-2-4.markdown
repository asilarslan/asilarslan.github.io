<p>Just released v1.2.4 onto the Market. It&#8217;s a bug fix release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix FC when widget press is set to open Facebook app.</li>
<li>Convert new graph links to old format (will fix the bug for Places notifications were you get &#8220;Page requested not found&#8221;)</li>
<li>Fix for ldpi devices where the Facebook login window doesn&#8217;t allow scrolling.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will probably be the last update before v2.</p>
