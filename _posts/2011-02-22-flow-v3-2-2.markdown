Hey,

Version 3.2.2 of Flow is being uploaded onto the Market as we speak. It includes:

*   Improve look and Flow: colour & icons
*   Gingerbread style notifications icons for users running Gingerbread. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not entirely happy with the new icons, and they will probably be improved in the next release.
*   Add/Remove friend options under Profile Info.
*   Set photo as Profile Pic Menu option on Photo Viewer.
*   Changelog Menu option on Main Screen
