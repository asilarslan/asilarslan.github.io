I forgot to post the changelogs for these so here goes.

V1.0.4 was a small release:

*   Small bugfixes
*   Preliminary support to open the Facebook app when a notification is pressed. Only Inbox Messages really work at the moment, I&#8217;m still ripping the Facebook app apart. Unfortunately even this didn&#8217;t work as introduced a small bug into the app :-/

V1.0.5 was a small bugfix release which fixed the Facebook app bug.
