Flow v3.0.4 and v3.0.5 were released today. They include:

*   Lots of bugs fixed. I went through all of the crash reports and fixed the ones that I could work out why they failed. The majority were caused by database corruption, which should never happen again now.
*   **New Favourites drawer**
*   New &#8216;Home&#8217; screen. This is an experiment and by no means final. I like it though.
*   New Groups screen (Events will be in the next release)
*   Layout fixes (RTL fixes, and other things such as spinner size, spacing around items).

Let me know how you get on!
