Hey everyone,

I&#8217;m now back from my holiday (vacation) and I&#8217;ve fixed a couple of issues that you&#8217;ve seen over the past week:

*   Fixed opening Notifications. Facebook must have changed something small on their end, but it was a simple fix.
*   Fixed List not being &#8216;big&#8217; enough to hide the Pull Refresh view with small lists
*   Photo Tags now align up properly in both portrait and landscape
*   New &#8216;View Album&#8217; menu option when viewing a photo

I haven&#8217;t read through any of the emails I&#8217;ve had over the past week (I&#8217;ve had over 150 Flow related emails), and I probably won&#8217;t have time to reply to them all. I&#8217;m going to create a FAQ page on this blog which will answer the questions I get Â asked all the time.
