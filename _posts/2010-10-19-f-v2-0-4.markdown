Hey,

Version 2.0.4 was released this morning as a bug fix release:

*   Switched to the older and more robust FQL based Facebook API. The Graph API was the reason why so many problems occured in the previous v2.0.x releases. This has some implications, some good, some bad but overall performance should be improved.
*   Now using GZIP compression to decrease the amount of data actually being transmitted (typically around 60-70% less data).
*   Fixed the FC with Inbox Messages.
*   Other small bug fixes which I can&#8217;t remember.

Let me know how you get on!

Chris
