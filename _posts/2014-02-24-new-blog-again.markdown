Just a quick post.

You may have noticed that this site has changed yet again. After my [Color Matching](http://chris.banes.me/2014/02/18/colour-matching/) post last week, I saw quite a few comments saying that the site was slow.

The site was WordPress based with all of the standard optimizations: [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) for static caching and then [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) for it's CDN goodness. Even though it had these, the site was still painfully slow at times.

## Along goes a ghost

I had a bit of time over the weekend to see how I can improve the site. In the end, the result is switching to [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org), specifically their hosted blogs.

For $5 per month they host this blog with the minimum of fuss. I have nothing but good things to say about Ghost; it's fast, clean, simple and the epitome of [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

I'm currently using the awesome open-source [Ghostium](http://ghostium.oswaldoacauan.com/) theme. I still need to tweak the fonts, but overall I'm very happy.
