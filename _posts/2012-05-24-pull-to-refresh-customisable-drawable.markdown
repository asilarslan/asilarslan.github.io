<p>Following on from yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.senab.co.uk/2012/05/23/pull-to-refresh-indicator-concept/">post</a> about making Pull-to-Refresh more discoverable, today I&#8217;ve made it a bit more customisable. As you can see above, instead of the standard Android indeterminate spinner we have Andy spinning instead. This drawable is completely customisable by you.<!--more--></p>

<p>That&#8217;s not all as I&#8217;ve removed the rotating arrows, and added an effect so that the drawable (in this case Andy) is rotated based on how far you&#8217;ll scrolled. It makes more sense when you use it.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If you&#8217;d like to test this, I&#8217;ve built a new version of the sample app for download here: <a href="http://bit.ly/Lou5lv">http://bit.ly/Lou5lv</a> <em>(the GridView sample has the Andy custom drawable).</em></span><br />
<strong>EDIT: This has now been released into v1.3.0. See here: <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh">https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh</a></strong></p>
