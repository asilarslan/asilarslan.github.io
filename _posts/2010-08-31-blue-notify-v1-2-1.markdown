Hi.

Blue Notify v1.2 has just been released onto the Market. The main things in this release are:

*   New notification icons
*   Widget has been redesigned to look like a launcher.
*   Configurable Birthday refresh time.
*   Friends&#8217; Birthday notification now properly open Facebook app (at their profile) if enabled.
*   LED options: colour and speed (Speed may need tweaking).
*   Uses Wake Lock when refreshing (guarantees CPU time for the application).
*   Stops trying to refresh when no connection is detected.
*   <strike>Bug where the wrong notification is launched, should be fixed.</strike> &#8211; *Reverted to fix FC*
*   More stuff which I&#8217;ve forgotten about.

Let me know if you have any problems!

**V1.2.1**

Reverted one of the fixes above to fix an FC
