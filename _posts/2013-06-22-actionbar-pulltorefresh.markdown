<p>So this is my first blog post on ActionBar-PullToRefresh. I've been mainly talking about it on Google+ up until now as it simply was not ready for production use. Well today I tagged and push v0.4 of the project, which adds the main missing feature: automatically styling based on your Action Bar style.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>First of all here's a video of how it works:</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>So here's a non-exhaustive list of it's features:</p>

<ul>
<li>By default mirrors the Gmail implementation: grow from center progress bar.</li>
<li>ListView, GridView, ScrollView and WebView support.</li>
<li>Full <a href="http://actionbarsherlock.com/">ActionBarSherlock</a> support.</li>
<li>Powerful API which allows complete customisation.</li>
<li>Automatic styling from Action Bar.</li>
<li>Allow setting of the displayed text.</li>
</ul>

<p>See something missing? Create an <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/issues/new">issue</a> on the repo.</p>

<h2>Should I use this?</h2>

<p>That's totally up to you, but from my perspective the code is solid (but untested). This type of UX is also not in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/">Android Design</a> guidelines so you may want to wait to see if it becomes standardised before using this.</p>

<p>By the way, if you're already using this (or planning to) let me know!</p>

<h2>OK, I'm sold</h2>

<p>Head on over to the GitHub repository then! <a href="http://chrisbanes.github.io/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/">http://chrisbanes.github.io/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/</a></p>

<p>There's a lot of information on how to use the library, as well as sample APKs to download and try yourself.</p>
