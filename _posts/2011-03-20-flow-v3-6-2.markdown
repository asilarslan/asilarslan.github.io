Hey,

As I&#8217;m going on holiday (vacation) again a couple of days, I&#8217;ve decided to put out another release tonight to fix some more issues I&#8217;ve found in my Error Reports:

*   New App Update alert for when there&#8217;s a new version (only checks once a day, when you open the home screen)
*   Fix for some unusual database errors found in my logs
*   Popup now automatically closes if you Quick Reply and there&#8217;s only one unread notification
*   Other small bugfixes

Chris
