Hey,

Just a quick update on my progress on version 2. I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m about 50% towards releasing it onto the Market. I&#8217;ve wrote the screen and have &#8220;alpha&#8221; quality code updating and displaying the post/comments. I&#8217;ve now got to make some changes to the underneath of the application, and then also write the Places widget. 

I&#8217;m on course to have this finished in the next week, i&#8217;ll then test it for a couple of days. Therefore you should be getting the update within 2 weeks.
