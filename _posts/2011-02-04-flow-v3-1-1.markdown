Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just put v3.1.1 of Flow onto the Market. This isn&#8217;t a big update but it contains some nice stuff!

*   Fixed bug where items would be &#8216;one-off&#8217; when Long Pressing. Will fix being able to copy/paste on the status input box too.
*   Fixed bug a couple of bugs with Birthday notifications. One where the preference wouldn&#8217;t be read correctly, and another where it wouldn&#8217;t automatically fetch your friends from Facebook if needed.
*   Pull To Refresh! This is currently just on List screens (newsfeed, wall, groups, events and albums).
*   Shake To Refresh! Same as above in that it&#8217;s only available on List screens. This can be disabled in the Preferences.
*   Slight re-organisation of Preferences.

I&#8217;ve tried to film the new refresh function, but the quality of my camera is appalling.
