Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just uploaded Flow v3.3 onto the Market. It includes:

*   Ability to Post and Comment as your Page! There&#8217;s no setup needed, just go to your Page and Flow will automatically Post/Comment as your Page instead of your personal account.
*   Fix for Events not displaying (again due to Facebook changing things).
*   New Preference to select how Inbox Message Notifications are launched (under Launch Settings).
*   Home Button to open Inbox Messages based on above Â Preference
*   New Preference to make Facebook Notifications &#8216;Quiet&#8217; (under Alert Settings).
*   Correct number of Likes are now downloaded
*   Fix Battery Consumption of Notification Popup
*   Improve the Checkin Places list, now more resilient to low accuracy locations.
*   Fix for Alternate Login problems with QVGA devices.

Let me know how you get on.
