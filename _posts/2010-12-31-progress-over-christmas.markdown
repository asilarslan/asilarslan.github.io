Hi everyone,

Just a quick update for you all. I&#8217;ve just got back home from Christmas celebrations with the family to an Inbox filled with f-plus related emails for me to sift through. I decided that I wasn&#8217;t going to take my laptop or reply to email over the period as I needed a bit of a break <img src='http://i0.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

Anyway,Â  today I&#8217;ve fixed several things that people have emailed me about, and will continue to work on new stuff over the next day or so. Here&#8217;s a list of what you can expect in the next release (v2.4):

*   Birthday Notification launching fixed.
*   Fix for a couple of FCs that have cropped up in the Crash Report logs.
*   New version of the database library F-Plus uses ([OrmLite][1]).
*   Better interface Posts with Media Items (such as a multiple photos). There&#8217;s now a scrolling image widget (Gallery) which will display all the images that Post references.
*   (Basic) News Feed

Expect it to be out tomorrow some time.
