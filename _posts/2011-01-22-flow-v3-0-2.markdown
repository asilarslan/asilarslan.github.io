Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve just released version v3.0.2 of Flow (formerly f-plus) onto the Market. The release includes:

*   New name & logo!
*   Lots of bug fixes
*   Better looking Friend List
*   Your profile now appears in Friend List (needed for Photo Tagging)
*   Fixed Notification Popup error
*   Notification Popup should now appear on Lock screen

The reason why the name of the application has changed is simple, I had to. I received an email from Facebook on Thursday saying that I had infringed their trademarks through the use of the letter f in the previous name. The problem wasn&#8217;t the actual use of the f, but the fact that it obviously referred to Facebook:

> *We are referring to your application in the Android market, the logo of which is derivative of Facebook&#8217;s lowercase f logo. Additionally, using the name &#8220;f+&#8221; does not meet our brand usage guidelines because the F in the name is meant to connote Facebook.*

If I chose not to comply, they would revoked the application&#8217;s access to Facebook meaning no-one would be able to use it.
