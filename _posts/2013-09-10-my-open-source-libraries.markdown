title: (My) Open Source Libraries

<p>Over the past few months I've been receiving a ton of emails, tweets, G+ mentions and GitHub issues in connection with my open source libraries. So I thought I would set out what my plan is for them in the future, and the order in which I'll be tackling the backlog.<!-- more --></p>

<h2>ActionBar-PullToRefresh</h2>

<p>The library which is taking up the majority of my personal dev time at the moment before it hits v1.0. I've done this library a bit differently that my previous ones as I've developed it in the open, whereas I tend to bring stuff up to a usable v1.0 state before releasing.</p>

<p>My plan is to release v1.0 pretty soon (within the next few weeks) and then leave it for a while while I tackle the bugs from my other projects below. So if you have any feature requests or bugs, now is the time to test the library.</p>

<h2>PhotoView</h2>

<p>To be honest, this library is in a bit of a mess at the moment. Looking through the code I do not like some of the 'quick fixes' I put in there. Which leaves me with two options: rewrite it, or quickly fix the current issues and then deprecate it.</p>

<p>My feeling at the moment is for option two as the first option is going to take a lot of time which I do not have. Either way, I'll get it building with Gradle and publish the AAR to Maven Central.</p>

<h2>Android-BitmapCache</h2>

<p>I consider this library pretty feature complete, as it does what I want it to do - and no more. At the moment the only thing I want to do is create a Gradle build script and publish the AAR to Maven Central.</p>

<h2>Android-PullToRefresh</h2>

<p>I deprecated this library earlier this year due to lack of time to maintain it. While that reason still holds true I do have this nagging urge to improve the API, bringing it more in-line to the API in ActionBar-PullToRefresh.</p>

<p>This may or may not happen, but it's a possibility.</p>
