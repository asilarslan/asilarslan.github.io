Hey everyone,

I&#8217;ve ust uploaded v3.7.3 of Flow onto the Market:

*   New Share Post feature (long press on a post in the news feed/wall, or press the button at the top when viewing a post)
*   Lots of bug fixes which caused FCs
*   Rewrite of the Album/Photo fetching. Less hacky stuff in the background which should produce less problems.
*   Fix problem where long-press wouldn&#8217;t work on NewsFeed/Wall if &#8216;Pull To Refresh&#8217; was disabled
*   Fix Keyboard options for Post Text Box (now says &#8216;Send&#8217; when writing in landscape, and pressing the button posts the status).
