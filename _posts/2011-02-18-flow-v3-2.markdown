Hey everyone,

Flow v3.2 has just been released onto the Market. I know I&#8217;m slightly biased but I&#8217;m really happy with where Flow is at the moment! This release includes:

I&#8217;ve now added a nice new native screen where you can checkin. It now also correctly displays tagged users in Checkin Posts.<a href="http://178.239.161.90/~senabcou/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/checkin2.jpg" rel="lightbox[359]"><br /> </a>

## Post Tags

<a href="http://i2.wp.com/178.239.161.90/~senabcou/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buttons.jpg" rel="lightbox[359]"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-360" title="buttons" src="http://i2.wp.com/178.239.161.90/~senabcou/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/buttons.jpg?resize=150%2C72" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>You can now tag your friends in posts, this is something that NO other app can do, official or not, iPhone or Android. There is a caveat to this, in that the users you tag are not notified that they have been tagged. There is nothing I can do about that at present, but I&#8217;m going to keep looking into it. Just make sure that you don&#8217;t change the tagged persons name in the post (this is a &#8216;bug&#8217; which will be fixed in the next release). Because of this change, I&#8217;ve added some buttons to the post status screen. The first tags a friend, second provides easy access to checkin function and the last submits it all.

## New Icons
