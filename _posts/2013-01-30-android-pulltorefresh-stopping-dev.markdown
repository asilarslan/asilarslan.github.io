title: Android-PullToRefresh â€“ Stopping Development

<p>Android-PullToRefresh was started about 18 months ago, as I needed it for a project (Friendcaster). Since then I&#8217;ve kept maintaining the project, pushing it forward and adding new features.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>Well today I&#8217;m stopping development.</strong> There are two reasons for this, the first is that it is feature complete. The second reason is that the volume of &#8216;issues&#8217; I get is taking up too much of my time.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s open source. If you want something added or fixed, you have the source to do so.</p>

<p><em>So to be clear, I will not be responding to any more Github issues, emails or social posts about Android-PullToRefresh.</em></p>
