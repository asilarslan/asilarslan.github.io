Hey,

Flow v3.1.2 was just released onto the Market. It&#8217;s a small release but contains two things which people have been emailing me (a lot) about lately; including:

*   Small Local Cache for Newsfeed & Walls. No more unnecessary loading.
*   Notification Popup now shows over lock screen
*   Couple of other little fixes

Version 3.2 is in the works. I&#8217;m currently working on Places, and being able to Checkin.
