Hey,

Earlier this evening I put v2.1 of f-plus onto the Market. I&#8217;ll put up a detailed a detailed change later but he&#8217;s a summary:

*   New home screen
*   Places is still slightly broken, working on it for v2.1.1
*   Small UI improvements across the board
*   Displays when the last updates were
*   Facebook notifications no longer optional

A couple of people have asked how push notifications will work. I&#8217;ll post about it in a couple of days when i&#8217;ve finalized it all, but I will be using C2DM meaning that the first version be only be available on Froyo devices. Push will be available in v2.2, there&#8217;s no ETA but I&#8217;m guessing week(s) rather than months.
