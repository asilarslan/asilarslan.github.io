Hey everyone,

Just put v2.3.1 of f-plus onto the Market. It includes:

*   Marking emails as read (and archiving them for Paid users) now correctly syncs up to Gmail. Previously it would just show in the Gmail application.
*   Re-enabled GZIP compression. Performance boost when getting posts and refreshing.
*   Free: Fix FC on Photo Uploader caused by some Admob remnants which I didn&#8217;t remove.
*   Now uses Wake Lock for Gmail checking. Stops service being killed.
*   Changed the pattern F-Plus looks for to match Facebook emails from just &#8216;*@facebookmail.com&#8217; to &#8216;*@facebook*&#8217;. Hopefully should enable more users for notifications.

**There seems to be a problem with the app on Donut at the moment (it seems it&#8217;s VM can&#8217;t handle some of the optimizations). I&#8217;m going away for the weekend but should have a fix out on Sunday.**

Let me know how you get on.
