I&#8217;m currently making some progress for the widget, but want to know what you want from it. At the moment the widget I have in mind in a simple 1&#215;1 widget which will display how many notifications you currently have. This will be probably be extended to be 2&#215;1 to include Inbox Messages in the same way. This is currently working and I am testing it as we speak. This is the sort of widget that will be available in v1.1.

What I&#8217;d like to know though, is what sort of widget you&#8217;d like in future releases?
