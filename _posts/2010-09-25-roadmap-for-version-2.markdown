First off Blue Notify will no longer be known as Blue Notify and the name will be changed. Â The new name is yet to be chosen but version 2 is when the new name will take effect. The reason for the name change is due to my new employers not liking a certain word in the name. If you have any suggestions for the name, please comment below. <img src='http://i2.wp.com/www.senab.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

## Features

I have quite a few features in plan for version 2:

*   No more opening the browser for notifications, a native screen will be created.
*   Facebook Places post widget
*   Improved help and changelog view
*   Improve standard widget
*   Notifications List screen

If you have any features you&#8217;d like in the app, let me know. I&#8217;m starting work on this today, should be out soon.
