Hi everyone,

I&#8217;ve personally I&#8217;ve decided that version 3.0 should be a public beta. I&#8217;m only releasing the &#8216;free&#8217; version of the application as a beta (for obvious reasons).

*   New Profile Screen (icons need to be finished for final release).
*   Correctly launches Group and Event links in new profile screen (can see wall and other info). 
    *   The ability to RSVP to events will be in the final version.
*   New ActionBar (try pressing on a comment & long-pressing on Post)
*   Fix broken timestamp
*   Fix Friend Birthday&#8217;s
*   Lots and lots of other stuff.
*   Crash Reporting logic has reversed. **Please go into the Preferences &#8211;> Advanced Settings and untick &#8216;Disable Crash Debugging&#8217;.**

Let me know how you get on, and if you have any problems!
